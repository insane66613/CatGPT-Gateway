# ChatGPT Model Switching

MimicGate supports browser-backed ChatGPT model switching. When a request includes
a configured model id, MimicGate opens the ChatGPT model picker, selects the
matching model and effort, waits for confirmation, and then sends the prompt.

On the ChatGPT Business UI checked in September 2026, the composer button shows
the current effort. Its menu has **Select model** (`Latest`, `GPT-5.6 Sol`, and
`GPT-5.5` on the checked account) and a **Power** slider with `Instant`,
`Medium`, `High`, and `Extra High`. Model availability varies by account.
MimicGate also keeps the older Advanced/Configure picker fallbacks.

## Quick Use

OpenAI-compatible request:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dummy123" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-5.6-sol",
    "reasoning_effort": "high",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say which mode you are using."}]
  }'
```

For `/v1/responses`, use the same base model with `"reasoning": {"effort": "high"}`.
Clients normally send these fields from their saved model and reasoning settings;
users do not need to edit JSON for each request.

Native request:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dummy123" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "gpt-5.5", "message": "Hello from a selected model."}'
```

List configured and discovered model ids:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/models -H "Authorization: Bearer dummy123"
```

The model list advertises base models rather than a separate entry for each
reasoning effort. For example, select `gpt-5.5` and send `reasoning_effort` instead
of choosing `gpt-5.5-high` from the list. Distinct Pro entries remain listed.

Existing effort-suffixed ids still work, including configured aliases such as
`gpt-5.5-thinking`. Clients without a reasoning setting can continue sending
these ids, although they no longer appear in `/v1/models` when their base model
is also listed. A standalone configured model remains listed even if its name
ends in an effort label.
Ollama's model list and effort profiles remain unchanged.

An explicit `reasoning_effort` overrides the configured effort for a base model.
Without it, configured models use `CHATGPT_MODEL_SETTINGS`; `mimicgate-browser`
preserves the browser selection unless a default model is configured. Keep
legacy suffixed requests free of a conflicting effort field: configured aliases
use the explicit field when supplied, while dynamically resolved suffixes take
precedence over that field. This compatibility behavior is unchanged.

Requested effort is mapped to the available browser controls, using the nearest
available level when necessary. The API field does not create effort levels
that the account's picker does not offer.

## Configuration

`CHATGPT_MODEL_ALIASES` maps public API ids to visible ChatGPT **Model** labels:

```env
CHATGPT_MODEL_ALIASES=gpt-5.6-sol=GPT-5.6 Sol|5.6 Sol|Instant,gpt-5.5=GPT-5.5|5.5
```

Format:

```text
public_id=Primary UI Label|Alternate UI Label|Another Alternate
```

`CHATGPT_MODEL_SETTINGS` maps those ids to the **Effort** submenu:

```env
CHATGPT_MODEL_SETTINGS=gpt-5.6-sol=Instant,gpt-5.6-sol-medium=Medium,gpt-5.6-sol-high=High,gpt-5.6-sol-extra-high=Extra High,gpt-5.6-sol-pro=Pro,gpt-5.5=Instant,gpt-5.5-medium=Medium,gpt-5.5-high=High,gpt-5.5-thinking=High,gpt-5.5-extra-high=Extra High,gpt-5.5-pro=Pro
```

`gpt-5.5-thinking` remains as a compatibility alias for GPT-5.5 + High.

If a request uses `mimicgate-browser`, MimicGate keeps the current browser-selected
model unless `CHATGPT_DEFAULT_MODEL` is set:

```env
CHATGPT_DEFAULT_MODEL=gpt-5.6-sol-high
```

By default, if a configured model is not visible in the account's picker, MimicGate
logs the visible options and continues with the currently selected browser
model. To fail the request instead:

```env
CHATGPT_MODEL_SWITCH_STRICT=true
```

`CHATGPT_MODEL_SWITCH_TIMEOUT` is measured in milliseconds and controls how long
MimicGate waits for the selected model label to appear after clicking an option.
For example:

```env
CHATGPT_MODEL_SWITCH_TIMEOUT=10000  # 10 seconds
```

Do not set `CHATGPT_MODEL_SWITCH_TIMEOUT=1` expecting one second; that is 1 ms.

## Per-app reasoning defaults

Apps that do not send reasoning effort can use a default configured in MimicGate:

```env
CHATGPT_APP_REASONING_EFFORTS=karakeep=medium,paperlessgpt=high,linkwarden=low,mealie=medium
```

The app name comes from the URL path. For example, requests to
`http://mimicgate:8000/paperlessgpt/v1/chat/completions` use `high`, while requests
to `/karakeep/v1/chat/completions` use `medium`. Each app can keep sending a base
model such as `gpt-5.6-sol`; model selection remains separate from effort.

Set this variable on the MimicGate container and recreate it after changing the
value. The supplied Compose file passes it through from the host environment.
Other Compose files must include it under the MimicGate service's `environment`.
The apps themselves do not need a reasoning setting.

Defaults apply to app-scoped Chat Completions and Responses, including streamed
and asynchronous chat requests. They also apply to image attachments sent in
those requests. They do not apply to image-generation, native `/chat`, or Ollama
routes, or to other providers.

Explicit request effort (`reasoning_effort` for Chat Completions or
`reasoning.effort` for Responses) takes precedence. Legacy effort-suffixed model
IDs and Pro selections retain their existing behavior. A legacy effort-suffixed
`CHATGPT_DEFAULT_MODEL` also retains its behavior when a browser alias is used.
Avoid sending contradictory model suffixes and explicit effort fields.

Plain `/v1/...` requests and unknown app names keep the existing effort defaults.
An empty variable leaves behavior unchanged. Matching is case-insensitive;
app names use letters, digits, dots, underscores, or hyphens. Malformed entries,
unknown effort values, and duplicate app names fail validation at startup.
Effort is mapped to the account's available browser controls as usual.

## Notes

- Model availability depends on the logged-in ChatGPT account and plan. Free/Go
  accounts may show Luna and a Think control instead of these controls.
- MimicGate uses **Select model** and **Power** on the current picker. Older
  layouts use **Show advanced options**, **Model**, and **Effort**.
- UI labels change over time. Update `CHATGPT_MODEL_ALIASES` when ChatGPT
  renames picker items.
- The CLI also supports `/model <name>`, which changes the model id sent to the
  API for later messages.
- Issue #8 is implemented by `src/chatgpt/model_registry.py` and
  `ChatGPTClient.ensure_model()`.

# Google Gemini Model Switching

When `PROVIDER=gemini`, MimicGate supports browser-backed model switching for Google Gemini (`https://gemini.google.com`).

MimicGate interacts with Gemini's mode switcher (`<bard-mode-switcher>`) to select the requested model tier before submitting the prompt.

## Available Gemini Models

| Public Model ID | Menu Label | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `gemini-browser` | *(Active model)* | Preserves whichever model is currently selected in the browser UI. |
| `gemini-3.8-flash` | `3.8 Flash` / `Flash` | Default high-speed multimodal model. |
| `gemini-3.6-flash` | `3.6 Flash` | Previous generation Flash model. |
| `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`| `3.5 Flash-Lite` | Ultra-low-latency lightweight model. |
| `gemini-3.1-pro` | `3.1 Pro` | Advanced reasoning model (available on Google One AI Premium / Advanced accounts). |
| `gemini-extended-thinking` | `Extended thinking` | Deep reasoning with explicit chain-of-thought. |

Supported aliases:
- `gemini-flash`, `gemini-2.0-flash`, `gemini-1.5-flash` map to Flash (`gemini-3.8-flash`).
- `gemini-pro`, `gemini-1.5-pro` map to `3.1 Pro` (`gemini-3.1-pro`).

## Configuration

### Default Model (`GEMINI_DEFAULT_MODEL`)

Sets the model selected when a request does not specify one, or when `gemini-browser` is requested:

```env
GEMINI_DEFAULT_MODEL=gemini-browser
```

Default: `gemini-browser` (preserves the model currently selected in the Gemini web UI). To lock MimicGate to a specific model regardless of what is selected in the UI:

```env
GEMINI_DEFAULT_MODEL=gemini-3.8-flash
```

### Model Fallback Control (`GEMINI_MODEL_FALLBACK`)

Controls behavior when an application sends a model ID that is not supported by Gemini (for example, downstream apps configured with ChatGPT model names like `gpt-5.6-sol` or `gpt-4o`):

```env
# Allow unrecognized models to fall back to GEMINI_DEFAULT_MODEL (default)
GEMINI_MODEL_FALLBACK=true

# Reject unrecognized models with HTTP 400 and log an error with supported models
GEMINI_MODEL_FALLBACK=false
```

When `GEMINI_MODEL_FALLBACK=true`, MimicGate logs a warning and routes the request to `GEMINI_DEFAULT_MODEL`.
When `GEMINI_MODEL_FALLBACK=false`, MimicGate rejects the request with HTTP 400 and logs an error listing available models.
